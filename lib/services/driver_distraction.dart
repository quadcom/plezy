/// Android Automotive OS driver-distraction gating for Plezy's `video` app
/// category (car app quality `DD-2` / `DD-3`).
///
/// Two obligations follow from `DD-2`, and this single predicate serves both:
/// audio must stop when driving starts, and it must not be resumable while
/// driving. The second obligation covers every path that can start audio, not
/// just OS media-session commands — a gapless track transition or queue
/// auto-advance landing just after driving starts must fail closed too.
///
/// Authority is the vehicle's own user-experience restrictions on the driver
/// display ([CarUxRestrictionsService]), which is the mechanism the platform
/// documents for apps that must separate "driving" from "not in the
/// foreground". Lifecycle state cannot make that distinction: the app is
/// equally not-resumed when the system covers it for driving and when a parked
/// driver opens navigation, so deriving authority from lifecycle alone silenced
/// parked background audio — something `DD-2` never asked for.
///
/// Where the vehicle cannot answer ([CarUxRestrictionState.unknown] — an older
/// head unit, a car service that failed to connect, or a driver display that
/// could not be resolved) the previous lifecycle rule still applies, including
/// its fail-closed treatment of a null state: a command arriving before the
/// first lifecycle message is denied, and nothing is playing that early, so the
/// strictness costs nothing.
